# Raytracer in Java
A raytracer written in Java 18 without external libraries.  
Following the guide [_Ray Tracing in One Weekend_](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) by Peter Shirley.  

I have implemented everything up to "Defocus Blur" and made it render 
multithreaded to make it faster.
